## üß† Interesting Code Snippet

Product class:
All materials such as toppings, drinks, chips are based on Product class, which holds all pricing options, product name.
The methods it has allow me to get price for the selected sandwich size.

Selection:
For chips, and drinks; user can choose a custom size, and that's not dependent on the bread size. As bread size is dependent on it's own size, bread also stored as a selection.
Selection is a generic class, which stores the product, and user selected SizePrice class: which holds selected Size, and a double Price.
