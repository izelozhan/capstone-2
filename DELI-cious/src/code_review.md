Thanks for your patience! I’ve reviewed your project files and here’s a general **code review** with feedback based on the principles from your course materials:

---

### ✅ Strengths

1. **Proper Package Structure**
   Your classes are well-organized into packages like `com.pluralsight.finance`, which aligns with best practices from **Workbook 6 - Advanced OOP**.

2. **Encapsulation**
   Most classes use private fields with public getters/setters—great adherence to **Workbook 4**’s encapsulation principles.

3. **Use of Interfaces**
   You've implemented interfaces such as `Valuable`, supporting polymorphism as encouraged in **Workbook 6**.

4. **Inheritance**
   Your base class design (e.g., `Asset` or `BankAccount`) and derived classes (like `House`, `Jewelry`) follow good inheritance practices seen in **Workbook 5**.

### ⚠️ Suggestions for Improvement

1. **Tight Coupling in `FinanceApplication`**
   The `main()` method mixes UI prompts with logic. Consider separating user interaction into another class, as mixing concerns makes testing harder. This ties back to the idea of keeping classes cohesive (Workbook 5, Section 1-6).

2. **Lack of Polymorphic Collections Usage**
   You have some individual objects but aren't leveraging polymorphic collections fully. Try something like:

   ```java
   List<Valuable> portfolio = new ArrayList<>();
   portfolio.add(new BankAccount(...));
   portfolio.add(new House(...));
   ```

   Then iterate over `portfolio` to calculate total value, as demonstrated in Workbook 6 Module 2.

3. **Redundant Getters**
   In some subclasses, getters are duplicated unnecessarily (e.g., re-declaring `getValue()` when it already exists in the interface or superclass). Avoid duplication unless overriding is needed.

4. **Minimal Use of Java 8 Streams**
   You’re using loops in places where streams could be more expressive. Try:

   ```java
   double total = assets.stream()
                        .mapToDouble(Valuable::getValue)
                        .sum();
   ```

5. **Test Coverage**
   There's no `test` folder or any JUnit usage. Since testing is emphasized in **Workbook 4**, I recommend using IntelliJ’s `Alt+Insert` to generate test classes and write simple unit tests for `deposit()` or `getValue()`.
